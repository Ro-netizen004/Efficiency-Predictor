The Fuel Efficiency Predictor is a machine learning web application that estimates a car’s miles-per-gallon (MPG) based on key vehicle attributes such as:

Cylinders

Displacement

Horsepower

Weight

Acceleration

Model Year

Origin

Users can enter these values through an intuitive form and receive a predicted MPG value instantly. The app leverages a trained machine learning model on historical automotive data to provide accurate estimates for a wide range of vehicles.

The application is ideal for car enthusiasts, students, or anyone interested in estimating fuel efficiency without manual calculations.
